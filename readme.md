thoughts for this play project

creating some video data display web app in different ways.
eg. vanilla js and html

- with angular
- with react
- with vue
- with svelte

ideas for the app
display 2 videos - eg 2 different toss blocks
click a button and play both
have a graph that displays some data eg, head position with a synchronised line matching part in video

v1 display 2 videos with some controls to control both.
-> was quite simple just in html and loading public videos
