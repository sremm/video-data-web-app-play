# thoughts for this play project

creating some video data display web app in different ways.

- vanilla js and html [done]
- with angular [done]
- with react [done]
- with vue
- with svelte
- with react and typescript

## The app

- display 2 videos
- click a button and play both
- have a graph that displays some data eg, head position with a synchronised vertical line matching part in video

# Notes while doing it

## Vanilla HTML and JavaScript

Started off with just html and javascript. Mostly used copilot prompts to code up the thing. To my surprise, everything was quite straightforward. With just 100 lines of code, we have.

## Angular version

Started off with giving chat gpt the html file as context and prompted it with `I want to now implement the same functionality in angular. I have angular cli instlled`

Looked promising, but started getting some errors. First I needed to install more things -> plotly angular, importing plotly had to be different.

When that was fixed, I started getting type errors, need to see whats up.

day 2 - tried to fix some type errors and add missing imports, but still problems,
-> try to use the angular-plotly component

trying to create default projects and follow the minimal example, perhaps the server-side rendering support was causing trouble?
-> it was server side rendering where the plotly import failed

jeesh, yeah, the code generated by copilot did not work, video elements undefined. and my brain in debuggin angular, does not get to answers, at least not today

-> perhaps scratch the code, start from plotly example, and redo
-> changed finding the divs in onInit instead of after init made it work

### Summary

the experience of getting it working in angular was way more painful, a steeper learning curve you could say

## React Version

Got it working, this time took a more step by step approach with information from copilot. Not sure if React was less of a hassle, or the approach.

But since i used Javascript, I think it was more similar to html/js version. I also did not use too much of React style interactions, mainly just one big component, as I also had in Angular to be fair
